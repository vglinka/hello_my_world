# Hello My World (HMW)

Text-based game. You read news from another world and events from the life of the characters in it.

❗ The project is at the concept development stage ❗

Events will be generated randomly from a finite number of components. This will include the generation of world news and events in the biographies of specific characters. You can also subscribe to the events of the selected character. The game will be easily internationalized using [Project Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/).

The game will include various settings created by the community. For example:

- Sci-fi
- Ancient
- Steampunk
- Fantasy
- Zombies
- Apocalyptic
- Cyberpunk
- ...

This may include worlds based on popular books, comics, games and movies.

You can run the game locally in a browser and have a unique world, or connect to a server (or maybe a Telegram bot) and read the same news as other people. And of course you can start your server with your own set of source parts of texts for generation.
